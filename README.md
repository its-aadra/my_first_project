## Project Overview

The Financial Investment recommender is a Python-based program (working prototype) that helps users make informed financial decisions. It divides the user's monthly salary into essential expenses, savings and investments. Based on the user's risk preference, it recommends suitable investment options such as Fixed Deposits (FD), Mutual Funds, Gold ETFs and Stocks.
This program is especially useful for women who want to start investing wisely and manage their salary efficiently.

## Features
- Calculates **50-30-20 salary allocation** for expenses, savings and investments.
- Provides **investment recommendations** based on risk preference (Low, Moderate, High)
- Gives suggestions depending on the **investable amount**
- Allows **multiple recommendations** without restarting the program
- Validates user input to avoid errors
- Simple, easy to understand **console interface**
